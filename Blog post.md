## Introduction
The real estate market is dynamic and complex, with fluctuations that can significantly impact investment outcomes. By leveraging historical data and sophisticated forecasting techniques, our goal is to provide Zillow's investment committee with actionable insights into the best zip codes for real estate investment.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to identify the top 5 zip codes for investment based on historical housing data from Zillow. Using time series forecasting, particularly the ARIMA model, we predict future property prices and recommend zip codes with the highest potential for appreciation and rental income.

## Business Problem
Zillow's investment firm faces the challenge of selecting lucrative zip codes for investment amidst a volatile market. Our analysis considers:

## Profit Potential: Expected price appreciation and rental yields.
* Risk: Volatility and stability of the price forecasts.
* Time Horizon: Appropriate investment duration.

## Objectives
* Data Collection: Gather and preprocess historical housing data from Zillow.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, seasonality, and correlations.
* Time Series Modeling: Apply ARIMA to forecast future property prices.
* Ranking and Recommendation: Develop a system to rank zip codes based on forecasted appreciation, rental yields, and risk metrics.

## Methodology
* Data Loading and Filtering
  * We started by loading the Zillow dataset and filtering it for the zip codes of interest.

* Data Preprocessing
  * Converted column names representing dates into datetime objects to facilitate time series analysis.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Explored historical price trends, identifying key patterns and seasonal behaviors in the selected zip codes. The data was reshaped from wide to long format to suit time series modeling.

* ARIMA Modeling
  * Fitted ARIMA models to forecast future housing prices for each selected zip code. The ARIMA model used included one autoregressive term, two differencing steps, and one moving average term.

* Interpreting Results
  * Evaluated forecasts based on profit potential, risk, and time horizon. The ARIMA(1, 2, 1) model provided insights into future price trends and volatility.

* Evaluation

### Conclusion

Our analysis identified the top 5 zip codes with high potential for real estate investment. These areas showed promising historical price trends and forecasted growth, balancing profit potential with manageable risk.

## Investment Recommendations

1. Diversified Investment:
  *  Invest in a mix of high-growth, high-volatility areas and stable, moderate-growth areas to balance returns with risk.

2. Long-Term Investment:
  *  Focus on long-term investments in areas with consistent upward trends. Short-term investments in volatile areas should be carefully monitored.

3. Continuous Monitoring:
  * Regularly update investment strategies based on new data and market conditions to optimize returns and manage risks.

By leveraging advanced data analytics and time series forecasting, Zillow's investment committee can make informed decisions to maximize returns. Our analysis provides a strategic roadmap for navigating the complex real estate market and identifying the most promising investment opportunities.
